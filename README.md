# wanna-play
This app is to serve to a community of people who share certain activity and need to make other members know that they are available for this activity in certain time. This should be the place where you find information who is available for this activity today, tomorrow, you can also enter when you are available to make others know.

I created this simple tiny app for our small tennis competition community. I named it wanna-play. There is no inspiration in the name of wanna-cry malware :) I heard about the malware’s name later on, really. But it is not important anyway. Important is that everyone would rather play then to cry, right? So lets move on. This little application is just to make other players know that you are about to play tennis on Wednesday afternoon, for example. So they know they can call you for details if they also have time that day. They don’t need to make many calls to find people having time play. One look here and you choose who you want to play with. Hope it helps :)

I like easily readable code and good code formatting. No preference for mess in the code and I follow this approach everywhere. I am also a fan of a good work organisation. That’s why I love to use Trello! It is really powerful tool and helps not to forget and not to get lost! So I use it :) You can see my planning here.

I will deploy this application to Heroku. Or maybe you prefer another service for Rails apps to run? Give me your tip!
