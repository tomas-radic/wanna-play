# wanna-play

I created this simple tiny app for our small tennis competition community in my hometown. I named it wanna-play. There is no inspiration in the name of wanna-cry malware :) I heard about the malware’s name later on, really. But it is not important anyway. Important is that everyone would rather play then to cry, right? So lets move on. This little application is just to make other players of our tennis competition know that you are about to play tennis on Wednesday afternoon, for example, and you seek someone to play with. So they see you listed here and know they can call you for details if they also have time that day. They don’t need to make many calls to find people having time to play. One look here and you choose who you want to play with. Hope it helps :)

I deployed this application to Heroku (https://wanna-play.herokuapp.com/en). Or maybe you prefer another service for Rails apps to run? Give me your tip! :)
